# IT632_6_EBookMaker
One of the best ideas to start experimenting with hands-on computer science projects for
students is working on an online eBook maker. This online eBook maker will allow users
to design and create eBooks free of cost. The system has two modules â€“ admin login
and author login. The admin can accept requests from users (authors), check and
validate their details, evaluate completed eBooks, and process the request by mailing
eBooks to the authors. Users can register in the system using the author login. After
filling in the necessary details, users can create new books, specify the context of books,
add the title, number of pages, add a book cover, etc. Existing users can simply log in
using their ID and password, and they can either create new books or resume editing the
existing (unfinished) eBooks. Authors can keep only three incomplete eBooks at a time,
of which they must complete at least one book before starting a new book.
